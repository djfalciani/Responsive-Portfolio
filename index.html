                    My name is Danny Falciani, and I am a software developer. I graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in 2010 as an Economics and Latin major. I was a member of my schoolâ€™s rowing team, both in high school and college. I enjoy anytime I can get out on the water! I like cooking and trying new recipes.                       
                </p>
                <p>
                    For past few years, I have been working as a developer. I am passionate about IT and Development. I continue to learn new skills and languages to help me design, build and deploy responsive applications that users enjoy.
